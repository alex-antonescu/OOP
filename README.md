# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each project demonstrates a specific topic in OOP, making it a valuable resource for understanding and applying OOP principles in Java. The folder structure organizes the projects sequentially to guide learners through progressively more advanced topics.

## Topics Covered
1. **[OOP1 - Intro](OOP1%20-%20Intro/)**
   - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, and methods.

2. **[OOP2 - Classes & Objects](OOP2%20-%20Classes%20&%20Objects/)**
   - A deep dive into the relationship between classes and objects, including instantiation and basic methods.

3. **[OOP3 - Sending Messages](OOP3%20-%20Sending%20Messages/)**
   - Demonstrates how objects communicate by calling methods on one another.

4. **[OOP4 - Built-in Classes](OOP4%20-%20Built-in%20Classes/)**
   - Explores the use of built-in Java classes such as `String`, `Math`, and `Scanner`.

5. **[OOP5 - Inheritance](OOP5%20-%20Inheritance/)**
   - Covers inheritance to show how classes can extend others to reuse and override behaviors.

6. **[OOP6 - Polymorphism](OOP6%20-%20Polymorphism/)**
   - Demonstrates method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.

7. **[OOP7 - Interfaces](OOP7%20-%20Interfaces/)**
   - Introduces interfaces as a way to define contracts for classes.

8. **[OOP8 - Exception Handling](OOP8%20-%20Exception%20Handling/)**
   - Explains how to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try-catch` blocks and custom exceptions.

9. **[OOP9 - Packages](OOP9%20-%20Packages/)**
   - Explores organizing classes into packages for better modularity and code management.

10. **[OOP10 - Collections](OOP10%20-%20Collections/)**
    - Introduces Java Collections Framework, including `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet`.

11. **[OOP11 - Concurrent Programming](OOP11%20-%20Concurrent%20Programming/)**
    - Demonstrates multithreading and concurrency in Java.

12. **[OOP12 - Exercises and Problems Proposed for Solving](OOP12%20-%20Exercises%20and%20problems%20proposed%20for%20solving/)**
    - A collection of exercises and problems to test and reinforce OOP knowledge.
